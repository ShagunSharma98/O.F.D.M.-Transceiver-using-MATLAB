O.F.D.M. Transceiver framework simulation using Matlab 

This simulation model contains the main file of OFDM named as OFDM.m that contains the code of OFDM transceiver.

Rest of the file are the helper functions that will be called as the execution of parent file(OFDM.m) begins and they are called.

You should have a basic understanding of calling functions within functions in MATLAB to execute the transceiver framework.

Some commands are commented and can be de-commented in case of need but make sure that execution of some of these commented commands will yield numerous plots as they will be called in a loop multiple times and depending on the configuration of the system and MATLAB version installed, the program might stop responding for a while.
